## Summary:

for few customers, we have been using Terraform Cloud using HCL language and also CDKTF in python to provide fully automated Infrastructure as Code Solution.

#### Topics

## Case Study

<span class="casestudy">We needed a infrastructure as Code Solution which we can leverage to fullfil our promise of delivering an infrastructure which is truly and fully automated.</span>

## Why we use CDKTF in python?

<span class="whyweusecdktfinpython">

Using CDKTF (Cloud Development Kit for Terraform) in Python offers several benefits:

Familiarity and Flexibility: Leverage Python’s programming constructs and your existing Python skills to write infrastructure as code.

Modularity and Reusability: Create reusable classes and methods for infrastructure components, adhering to the DRY principle.

Integration: Seamlessly integrate with Python's rich ecosystem of libraries and tools, enhancing automation and workflows.

Enhanced Abstractions: Utilize object-oriented programming for complex logic and conditional statements that are harder to express in HCL.

Improved Maintainability: Organize infrastructure code into modules and packages, making it easier to manage large projects.

By combining Python’s capabilities with Terraform's infrastructure management, CDKTF in Python provides a powerful and flexible approach to defining and managing cloud infrastructure. </span>
